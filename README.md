## Food Delivery Database - A technical database solution designed in UML and created using MySQL (2019)
### Project Overview
This project entailed designing and creating a database for a food delivery company that delivers high-quality meals to residences in less than 20 minutes with a team of delivery bikes. The database was modeled using a UML diagram and created in MySQL using MySQL Workbench. The database needed to contains:
- A list of clients
- A list of the different daily menu items
- A list of delivery drivers
- An order history for each client

### Technologies Utilized
- MySQL database

### Deliverables
A [UML diagram](https://github.com/mint-made/food-delivery-database/blob/master/UML-diagram.pdf) has been made to model this technical architecture. A MySQL database has been created using MySQL Workbench to [create tables](https://github.com/mint-made/food-delivery-database/blob/master/table-setup.sql) for [mock data to be inserted](https://github.com/mint-made/food-delivery-database/blob/master/data-insertion.sql). Some [Example queries](https://github.com/mint-made/food-delivery-database/blob/master/query-examples.sql) have been created to demonstrate to the client how to retrieve specific data from the database.
